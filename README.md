## Objective

## Project
This project involves the development of a versatile communication platform that enables seamless interaction through text channels and direct messaging, similar to platforms like Discord or Slack. Users can participate in structured discussions within topic-specific channels, send private messages, and engage in collaborative conversations in an intuitive and organized space. The platform incorporates role-based user permissions, distinguishing between Admins, who can manage channels and moderate messages, and Members, who can send and view messages. In addition to these core features, the project allows for customization and expansion by proposing an additional feature in consultation with a TA. The implementation is flexible, allowing developers to use any programming language or framework to create a scalable and user-friendly communication hub.
